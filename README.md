## Commit 1 Reflection notes: Handling connection and checking response
This Rust project implements a simple HTTP server that listens on 127.0.0.1:7878. The `handle_connection` function reads incoming requests line by line from a TcpStream and prints them in the terminal. Through this exercise, I learned how Rust ensures memory safety in network programming and how raw HTTP requests are structured.
